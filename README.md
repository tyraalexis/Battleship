# Battleship
#Summer 2023 internship project Battleship! This is Tyra and Miller's project.
#We made a playable game of Battleship against a CPU.
Run 'stage2.0complete.py' to run our code.


As interns at SWEG we have been tasked with coding and creating our interpretation of a classic game, Battleship. We were given write-ups to help guide us as we create the game from scratch. The collaborators/creators for this project are Tyra Smith and Miller Wood. We have worked to perfect the project through the differnt stages and this is our final interpretation of STAGE 2.0.

To play:
Once you have successfully imported into your terminal of choice and attatched to our IP Address (172.20.2.201), type 'python3" to signal toyour device what language the game is coded in.
You should firstly be welcomed and introduced to our "Project Battleship" game. Next you should be prompted to choose the size of your battleship grid. Insert a single integer in the range of 3-10 to generate your battleship board (i.e. input "6", code generates 6 x 6 grid). Next you will be asked where you would like to place YOUR battleship. Your blank grid will be displayed and you will be prompted to insert a single integer that corresponds with the row you would like your battleship to placed (i.e. input "4", your battleship will be placed on the fourth row on the grid.). Next you will be asked to do the same for the column you would like to place your ship. Your ship's coordinates should be displayed in front of you as well as an "I" on the grid in the cooresponding coordinates. You have successfully placed your battleship and are ready to begin playing! 

Behind the scenes your CPU opponent has placed their ship and is gearing up to target and attack your ship. As you are blind to where the CPU has placed their ship, it is blind to yours as well. 

On your first turn you will be asked on which row you would like to aim your missle.
